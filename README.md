# Bootstrap 4 Boilerplate (Gulp + Chrome Live Reload)
- Boostrap 4 (Alpha 6)
- Gulp 4 (Dev Branch)
- Chrome LiveReload

## Why Boilerplate?
I'm building multiple BS4 themes and I'm lazy to hit `F5` on every code changes. Also, I want to work with BS4 with Sass customization.

##  Quickstart

Since Gulp 4 is not yet released, you can install it this way:

You will need to remove your current gulp global package in order to do an upgrade:

```
$ npm rm -g gulp
$ npm install -g gulp-cli
```

then proceed with the installation:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

## Build Sytem

You can build with gulp by running:

```
$ gulp build
```

or watch with Chrome LiveReload:
```
$ gulp watch
```

`gulp compile` will be added soon

## TODO

- Add `gulp compile`
- Add tests?
